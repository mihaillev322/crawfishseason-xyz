<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About Crawfish Season</h1>

<p>Crawfish season brings up many questions for both newcomers and experienced enthusiasts. The timing varies by region, quality changes throughout the season, and understanding these patterns helps you get the best crawfish at the right time. Below are detailed answers to the most common questions about when crawfish are available, how to select them, and what to expect throughout the harvest months.</p>

<p>These answers draw from decades of commercial harvesting data, agricultural research, and practical experience from crawfish-producing regions. Whether you're planning a backyard boil or just curious about when to find the best crawfish at your local market, this information will help you make informed decisions.</p>

<details>
<summary>When is crawfish season in Louisiana?</summary>
<p>Crawfish season typically runs from late February through early July, with peak season occurring from March through May. The exact timing can vary slightly based on weather conditions and water temperatures. Louisiana's crawfish industry depends on both wild-caught and farmed crawfish, with farmed operations providing more predictable timing. Cold winters can delay the season start by 2-3 weeks, while warm winters may push it earlier. The <a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/">LSU Agricultural Center</a> tracks season timing annually and provides updates to farmers and consumers about optimal harvest periods.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What months are best for crawfish?</summary>
<p>The best months for crawfish are April and May when they are most abundant and at their largest size. During these peak months, crawfish are typically more flavorful and easier to find at restaurants and markets. The combination of optimal water temperatures, maximum growth period, and high population density makes these months ideal. Crawfish harvested in April and May have harder shells indicating better health, fuller tail meat, and sweeter flavor. Prices also drop during peak season due to abundant supply, making it the most economical time to purchase crawfish. If you're planning a crawfish boil or want to experience them at their best, schedule it for late April or early May.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does crawfish season end in summer?</summary>
<p>Crawfish season ends in summer because the warmer water temperatures cause crawfish to burrow deep into the mud to escape the heat. This natural behavior makes them much harder to catch, effectively ending the commercial harvest season. When water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit, crawfish enter aestivation—a dormant state similar to hibernation. They dig burrows 2-3 feet deep, seal themselves in mud chambers, and wait out the hot, dry period. This survival mechanism is instinctive and cannot be prevented even in managed farm ponds. Additionally, late spring is when female crawfish carry eggs, and harvesting during this period would damage future populations. These biological factors combine to create a natural endpoint for the season regardless of market demand.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When does crawfish season start in Texas?</summary>
<p>Texas crawfish season typically starts in early to mid-February, slightly later than Louisiana due to cooler temperatures in northern regions of the state. Southern Texas areas near Houston, Beaumont, and the Gulf Coast may see crawfish as early as late January in warm years. The season follows the same temperature-dependent pattern as Louisiana, with crawfish becoming active when water reaches 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit. Texas produces significantly less crawfish than Louisiana—approximately 5-8 million pounds annually compared to Louisiana's 120-150 million pounds—but the state has a strong crawfish culture, particularly in East Texas. Many Texas restaurants and markets import Louisiana crawfish during peak season to meet demand.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you get crawfish year-round?</summary>
<p>Fresh, live crawfish are only available during the natural season from late winter through early summer. However, frozen crawfish tail meat is available year-round at most seafood markets and grocery stores. The frozen product is typically processed during peak season (April-May) when quality is highest and prices are lowest. Frozen crawfish tails work well for dishes like étouffée, pasta, or fried crawfish, though they lack the social experience and full flavor of a traditional boil with live crawfish. Some restaurants in Louisiana and Texas offer crawfish dishes year-round using frozen tail meat. If you're craving crawfish outside the season, frozen tails are your only practical option, though serious enthusiasts simply wait for fresh season to return.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much do crawfish cost during peak season?</summary>
<p>During peak season in April and May, live crawfish typically cost between $2.50 and $4.50 per pound in Louisiana markets, with prices varying based on size grade and specific market conditions. Early season prices (January-February) run considerably higher at $6-9 per pound due to limited supply. Late season prices (June-early July) increase again to $4-7 per pound as availability declines. Restaurant prices for prepared crawfish boils range from $8-15 per pound depending on location and establishment. A typical crawfish boil for one person requires 3-5 pounds of live crawfish, meaning peak season offers significant savings. Size grades affect pricing too—larger crawfish (select or jumbo grades) command $1-2 more per pound than smaller grades even during peak availability.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between farmed and wild crawfish?</summary>
<p>Farmed crawfish come from managed ponds where farmers control water levels, vegetation, and harvest timing, while wild crawfish are trapped from natural waterways like swamps, rivers, and lakes. Farmed crawfish account for about 85% of Louisiana's production and offer more consistent sizing, cleaner shells, and predictable availability. Wild crawfish tend to have slightly more intense flavor and harder shells due to their natural diet and environment, but they're less consistent in size and harder to source reliably. Farmed operations have extended the season somewhat by managing water temperatures and pond flooding schedules. Both types are the same species (Procambarus clarkii, the red swamp crawfish) and are equally nutritious. Most consumers cannot reliably distinguish between farmed and wild crawfish in a blind taste test, though regional preferences exist.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is crawfish season the same in Oregon as Louisiana?</summary>
<p>No, Oregon crawfish season is completely different, running from April through October rather than January through July. Oregon harvests signal crawfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), a different species native to Pacific Northwest waters, from cold rivers and lakes rather than warm-water ponds. The colder climate delays the season start but extends it later into the year. Oregon crawfish are generally larger than Louisiana crawfish, sometimes reaching 6-7 inches, and have a slightly different flavor profile. The harvest methods differ too—Oregon relies entirely on wild trapping rather than farming. While Louisiana crawfish culture centers on boils with heavy seasoning, Oregon crawfish are often prepared more simply to highlight their natural sweetness. The two regions represent entirely different crawfish traditions despite sharing enthusiasm for these freshwater crustaceans.</p>
