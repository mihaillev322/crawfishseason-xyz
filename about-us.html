<h1>About Crawfish Season</h1>

<section>
<h2>Our Mission and Purpose</h2>
<p>Crawfish Season exists to provide accurate, timely information about crawfish availability across the United States. We recognize that crawfish represent more than just seafood—they're a cultural tradition, a seasonal celebration, and an important economic resource for thousands of families in Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and other producing states. Our goal is to help consumers, restaurants, and enthusiasts understand when crawfish are available, where to find them, and how to get the best quality at the right time.</p>
<p>The idea for this resource came from years of answering the same questions: When does crawfish season start? When is the best time to buy crawfish? Why can't I find fresh crawfish in August? These seemingly simple questions have nuanced answers that depend on geography, weather patterns, farming practices, and the biological rhythms of crawfish themselves. We've compiled research from agricultural extensions, wildlife departments, and industry sources to provide comprehensive answers.</p>
<p>We focus on practical information that helps people plan crawfish boils, understand pricing fluctuations, and appreciate the natural cycles that govern crawfish availability. Whether you're a Louisiana native who grew up with crawfish season or a newcomer curious about this regional tradition, our content aims to inform and educate without unnecessary complexity.</p>

<h2>Understanding Crawfish Seasons and Regional Differences</h2>
<p>Crawfish season timing varies significantly across different regions due to climate, water temperature, and species differences. The traditional Louisiana season runs from late January or February through early July, with peak harvest in April and May. This timing reflects the lifecycle of the red swamp crawfish (Procambarus clarkii), the species that dominates commercial production in the South.</p>
<p>Texas crawfish season follows a similar but slightly delayed pattern, starting in early February in most areas. The season in Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas aligns closely with Louisiana, though these states produce much smaller quantities. The Pacific Northwest presents an entirely different scenario—Oregon and Northern California harvest signal crawfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) from April through October, a completely different seasonal window.</p>
<p>These regional differences matter for several reasons. Consumers planning trips or events around crawfish availability need accurate local information. Restaurants and seafood markets must understand supply patterns to manage inventory and pricing. Even casual enthusiasts benefit from knowing when their local season peaks to experience crawfish at their best. Our regional guides provide specific details for each major crawfish-producing area, helping you find reliable information for your location. You can explore detailed timing information on our <a href="/">main crawfish season guide</a> and find answers to specific questions in our <a href="/faq">FAQ section</a>.</p>

<h2>Sources and Ongoing Research</h2>
<p>Our information comes from authoritative sources including university agricultural extensions, state wildlife and fisheries departments, industry associations, and published research. The <a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Louisiana State University Agricultural Center</a> provides extensive crawfish research and annual production data. <a href="https://agrilifeextension.tamu.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Texas A&M AgriLife Extension</a> offers valuable information about crawfish farming in Texas. The Auburn University Fisheries and Allied Aquacultures Department studies crawfish production in Alabama.</p>
<p>We also reference data from the <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service</a>, which tracks aquaculture production across the United States. State wildlife agencies including the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and similar agencies in other states provide regulatory information and population monitoring data. This combination of academic research, government data, and industry reporting ensures our information reflects current conditions and established scientific understanding.</p>
<p>Crawfish season timing can shift slightly from year to year based on weather patterns, water temperatures, and other environmental factors. We monitor these sources regularly to provide the most current information possible. Climate patterns, farming techniques, and market conditions evolve over time, and we update our content to reflect these changes. Our commitment is to maintain accuracy and usefulness as your primary resource for understanding when and where crawfish are available throughout their season.</p>
