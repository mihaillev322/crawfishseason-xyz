<h1>When Is Crawfish Season? Your Complete Guide to Peak Crawfish Months</h1>
<section>
<h2>Understanding Crawfish Season Timing</h2>
<p>Crawfish season represents one of the most anticipated times of year for seafood lovers across the southern United States. The season typically runs from late January through early July, with significant regional variations depending on climate, water temperatures, and local farming practices. Louisiana produces approximately 90% of the domestic crawfish supply, harvesting between 120 and 150 million pounds annually according to the <a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/communications/publications/agmag/archive/2023/spring/crawfish-season" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Louisiana State University Agricultural Center</a>.</p>
<p>The timing of crawfish season depends heavily on water temperature. Crawfish become active and begin reproducing when water temperatures reach 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit. As temperatures climb into the 65-75 degree range during spring months, crawfish activity peaks, making them easier to trap and harvest. This biological rhythm explains why March, April, and May consistently deliver the best quality and quantity of crawfish across most regions.</p>
<p>Commercial crawfish farming has extended the traditional season somewhat, but wild-caught crawfish still follow predictable natural patterns. Farmers flood their ponds in fall, allowing crawfish to burrow and reproduce. By late winter, juvenile crawfish emerge, growing rapidly through spring. The harvest intensifies as crawfish reach market size, typically 3-4 inches in length, providing the meaty tails consumers prefer.</p>

<h2>Regional Crawfish Seasons Across the United States</h2>
<p>Louisiana dominates crawfish production, but several other states have established their own seasons and traditions. Texas ranks second in production, with crawfish season in Texas typically running from February through June. The season starts slightly later than Louisiana due to cooler temperatures in the northern parts of the state, though southern Texas near Houston and the Gulf Coast mirrors Louisiana's timeline closely.</p>
<p>Alabama crawfish season follows a similar pattern, generally starting in late February and extending through early June. The state's crawfish industry remains smaller than Louisiana and Texas, but local farms and restaurants throughout Mobile, Montgomery, and Birmingham offer fresh crawfish during peak months. The Alabama Cooperative Extension System has documented growing interest in crawfish aquaculture, with more farmers entering the market each year.</p>
<p>Oregon represents an interesting outlier with its Pacific crawfish species. Oregon crawfish season runs from April through October, significantly different from southern states. The colder Pacific Northwest climate delays the start but extends the season later into summer and fall. Oregon harvests primarily signal crawfish from rivers and lakes rather than farmed ponds.

<h2>Peak Crawfish Season: What Makes April and May Special</h2>
<p>Peak crawfish season occurs during April and May when multiple factors align perfectly. Water temperatures stabilize in the ideal 68-75 degree range, crawfish have reached optimal size after months of growth, and abundance hits its highest point before summer heat arrives. During these months, crawfish are not only more plentiful but also offer better meat-to-shell ratios and sweeter flavor profiles.</p>
<p>Pricing reflects this seasonal abundance. Crawfish prices typically drop to their lowest points in April and May, often ranging from $2.50 to $4.50 per pound for live crawfish in Louisiana markets, compared to $6-8 per pound during early or late season. Restaurants feature crawfish boils prominently on menus, and festivals throughout Louisiana and Texas celebrate the harvest. The Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival, held annually in May since 1960, attracts over 100,000 visitors during peak season.</p>
<p>Commercial harvesters report their highest yields during these peak months. A productive crawfish pond can yield 1,500 to 3,000 pounds per acre during April and May, according to Louisiana State University research. This productivity makes the brief window economically crucial for the estimated 1,400 crawfish farmers operating in Louisiana alone. The quality difference is noticeable—peak season crawfish have harder shells, fuller tails, and richer flavor compared to early or late season specimens.</p>

<h2>Why Crawfish Season Ends in Summer</h2>
<p>Crawfish season concludes in early to mid-summer due to the species' biological response to rising temperatures. When water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit, crawfish enter a survival mode, burrowing 2-3 feet deep into mud to escape the heat and find moisture. This behavior, called aestivation, is similar to hibernation but occurs during hot, dry periods rather than cold ones.</p>
<p>During aestivation, crawfish seal themselves in underground chambers and become essentially impossible to harvest commercially. Their metabolism slows dramatically, and they can survive for months in this dormant state. This natural cycle explains why even crawfish farms cannot extend the season indefinitely—the crawfish simply disappear into the substrate regardless of human intervention.</p>
<p>The end of season also coincides with reproductive cycles. Female crawfish carry eggs attached to their tails during late spring and early summer. Responsible harvesting practices avoid this period to ensure population sustainability for the following year. The <a href="https://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/page/crawfish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries</a> monitors crawfish populations and provides guidelines for sustainable harvest practices. By late June or early July, most commercial operations have concluded their harvest, draining ponds and preparing for the next cycle. Understanding when crawfish season ends helps consumers plan their purchases and explains why fresh crawfish become scarce during summer months.</p>
